# TO-DO:
# (1): implement basic 'slash' ("/") commands, such as quit, whisper, emote, etc.
# (2): implement hierarchal-dependent commands, such as user versus server privileges.
# (3): consider if the server should also be able to write.
# (4): GUI that preserves the input window when a new message appears, as well as
#      allowing 'pretty' features such as colors.
# (5): change the server to be non interactive (i.e., the server does not chat with clients)
# (6): consider adding authentication and predetermined states (server keeps track of
#      accounts, ops, etc.

# SERVER FUNCTION
# (1): hosts a connection on specified port. Establishes a connection with a client
#      and continues to accept more connections via a Server class.
# (2): an input list is created to keep track of open connections.
# (3): a clientList is created to keep track of all of the clients for ease of sending
#      messages out to each client from another client.
#      The clientList is necessary to prevent duplicate messages sent back to the sender.
# (4): connections are closed when data is no longer being received by the socket.
#      These sockets are removed from the input and client list.
# (5): no condition has been set to close the connection, but the socket is
#      scheduled to close upon exiting the read/write loop.
# (6): *NEW* a users dictionary uses the socket as a key, with a list as the value.
#      The list-value defines as follows: [name, address, op_status]
#      op_status will be True or False.
