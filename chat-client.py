# TO-DO:
# (1): implement basic 'slash' ("/") commands, such as quit, whisper, emote, etc.
# (2): implement hierarchal-dependent commands, such as user versus server privileges.
# (3): consider if the server should also be able to write.
# (4): user aliasing.
# (5): GUI that preserves the input window when a new message appears, as well as
#      allowing 'pretty' features such as colors.

# SERVER FUNCTION
# (1): hosts a connection on specified port. Establishes a connection with a client
#      and continues to accept more connections via a Server class.
# (2): an input list is created to keep track of open connections.
# (3): a clientList is created to keep track of all of the clients for ease of sending
#      messages out to each client from another client.
#      The clientList is necessary to prevent duplicate messages sent back to the sender.
# (4): connections are closed when data is no longer being received by the socket.
#      These sockets are removed from the input and client list.
# (5): no condition has been set to close the connection, but the socket is
#      scheduled to close upon exiting the read/write loop.

# CLIENT FUNCTION
# (1): similar to the run_server() function, it will establish a connection
#      via a Client class.
# (2): if the selfClient.clientSocket is provided by select(), then data
#      is ready to be received by the client, from the server.
# (3): if no data is received, then the server has shut down. Close the
#      connection.
# (4): standard input will be sent to the server, and then sent to all
#      connected clients.
# (5): no condition has been set to close the connection, but the socket is
#      scheduled to close upon exiting the read/write loop.
